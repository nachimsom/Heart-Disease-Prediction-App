# Heart Disease Risk Prediction App
This project is a Machine Learning-powered web application to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient health parameters.

## 🚀 How It Works

The app uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. Users can input patient details such as age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more, and get an instant prediction of risk level.
